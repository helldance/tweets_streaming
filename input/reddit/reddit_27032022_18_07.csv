2,"At first, I thought Nano was too good to be true.",1107,tp0qcc,1648322432.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tp0qcc/at_first_i_thought_nano_was_too_good_to_be_true/,789,"Nano is legitimately the ultimate cryptoCURRENCY.  When I was researching what cryptocurrency to buy, I decided I wanted a crypto that had the best balance possible of the following attributes:

**1. Decentralization** \- Censorship resistance is the most important aspect of cryptocurrency

**2. Environmentally friendly** \- Consume minimal wasteful energy

**3. Scalable** \- More TPS = better

**4. Fairly distributed** \- This is important to prevent creators from dumping on the buyers

**5. Fast** \- Faster transactions are more convenient than slow transactions.

**6. Low transfer fees** \- Cheaper fees to send = better

**7. Low inflation** \- Inflation devalues existing coins and creates potential sell pressure.  It also incentivizes spending which is bad for the environment.

&#x200B;

Below is a description of Nano in regards to the above attributes:

**1.Decentralization**

Nano has hundreds of nodes.  The below image shows the decentralization of the bitcoin mining pools.

https://preview.redd.it/oanw3jskzrp81.jpg?width=715&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dcf0c42ba2ca00dfc9c4bbb34d2e31dbb0e10eb4

And this image shows the Nakomoto coefficient of Nano.

**2.Environmentally friendly**

Nano is as environmentally friendly as they come.  Nano does not have mining.  Below is a visualization of Nano’s power consumption compared to Bitcoins.

https://preview.redd.it/mpxrlc0ozrp81.png?width=1155&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad3981cde3af2df12ffc726fef8ccbae4100322a

**3.Scalable**

Nano does not have a hardwired limit on scalability (aka transactions per second).  Instead, Nano’s transactions per second are limited by hardware and bandwidth.

**4.Fairly distributed**

[Nano’s distribution](https://blog.nano.org/the-nano-faucet-c99e18ae1202) was not perfect, but it was very close. 95% of the Nano supply was given away for free for solving captchas.  Approximately 5% was reserved for the development of Nano.  It is estimated that about .2% of the Nano supply is still in the development fund.  It is extremely important to have a fair distribution.  Without a fair distribution, founders of cryptocurrencies could rug pull and sell the tokens they own, thus crashing the price.  This image shows just how much better Nano’s distribution is than most cryptocurrencies:

https://preview.redd.it/4ehzhfbpzrp81.jpg?width=761&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8585f04432c7e1a48b63f720975a3d33b64a1f0f

**5.Fast**

Nano transactions reach **finality** in about .3 seconds!  This is incredible.  If you deposit Nano to an exchange, most exchanges will let you instantly trade and withdraw the funds.  This is unlike a lot of cryptocurrencies which pretend to be instant, but exchanges know they can’t trust the funds until x confirmations, which takes anywhere from seconds, to minutes, to hours, depending on the currency.

**6.Low transfer fees**

Nano is feeless!  Here is a visualization that compares Nano’s fees to other coins.

https://preview.redd.it/g7bo24fwzrp81.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a65ae739b57073df57048b745636d92f292b85a6

**7.Low inflation**

Nano has no inflation.  This is phenomenal.  Unlike most PoW and PoS coins which constantly have new coins getting minted, no new Nano will ever be minted.  This is phenomenal because at $40K per Bitcoin, $36 million dollars in Bitcoin is minted every single day.  A lot of this Bitcoin has to be sold to pay for mining costs.  This is constant sell pressure on Bitcoin’s price which Nano does not have!

Below is an image that compares Nano’s inflation (and other features) to other coins.

https://preview.redd.it/gm9nxhcyzrp81.jpg?width=2047&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd42a4aa9243c8f711eaa31c70f5c0e73365323b

One complaint I have heard about Nano is that it does not have smart contracts.  This was an intentional design feature of Nano.  By being simple, Nano is able to have faster transactions and less chance of exploitation (to this day, Nano has never had a double spend).  I also personally believe decentralized finance is the number 1 use case of crypto (it is Bitcoin’s sole use case), and Nano does it better than any other cryptocurrency.

**Here is a video showcasing Nano:**

[Nano in the Real World: Lightning Fast | No Fees | Global Payments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR9U32u8ulE)

**Disclaimer:**

I did my best to post accurate information.  If I made any errors, please let me know.  This is not investment advice.

**Edit 1:**

One of the main concerns people posted is that since Nano is feeless, people are not incentivized to run nodes.  This is incorrect.  Bitcoin has mining fees and miners are paid to mine bitcoin.  However, Bitcoin also has nodes and Bitcoin node operators are paid no fees (they get none of the mining reward).  Yet, thousands of Bitcoin nodes are run by people to verify the ledger.  Nano nodes, like Bitcoin nodes, also verify the ledger.  Since running a node is a way to verify your holdings, businesses and people are incentivized to run them.  Just like with Bitcoin, finding enough people to run nodes has been a non-issue for Nano.

**Edit 2:**

Another thing I want to discuss is Bitgrail, which has come up in the posts below.  When Nano started out, one of the first exchanges to list it was Bitgrail.  Bitgrail ended up being a corrupt operation as the founder stole a lot of people’s Nano.  This had nothing to do with Nano as a currency.  However, it happened right after Nano’s initial growth, and many argue crashed Nano’s price as Bitgrail was the main exchange Nano was traded on.  I believe that even though Nano had the unfortunate event of being first listed on a corrupt exchange, Nano fundamentals are now better than ever.  Remember, after the dotcom bust, Amazon stock was trading very cheaply, but by all other metrics Amazon was doing better than ever."

> Google issued the warning on its official Chrome blog, revealing that Chrome on Windows, macOS and Linux is vulnerable to a new ‘zero-day’ hack (CVE-2022-1096). Zero-day is the most dangerous form of attack because it means the vulnerability is known to hackers before Google could issue a fix. As the company admits, “Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2022-1096 exists in the wild.” This means every Chrome user is vulnerable.

The issue seems to be quite serious, as it's the only change in this build.

To force your Chrome browser to update, go to settings and there select ""About Chrome""

Edit: this also affects Brave, so please update that too."
4,The amount of people here being 100% sure that their low-cap coin will make them rich is outrageous.,498,tp57oc,1648332078.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tp57oc/the_amount_of_people_here_being_100_sure_that/,389,"I recently just made a post here asking whether there are any other bluechip coins else than BTC and ETH. I was obviously prepared for spam bots etc. But still the amount of people that claimed that their low-cap coin, no one knows about with a 100M market cap or so, is 100% safe was just outrageous.

Many claimed that some low-cap coin they invested in will definitely be successful in the future and is actually 100% safe. The sad thing is that many seemed like they are not even a bot. 

Maybe that Crypto won't crash into disappearance and actually survive but there is absolutely no guarantee that it will be profitable, especially with low-cap coins. That's why it's: higher risk, higher rewards.

Obviously a low cap coin no one knows about could possibly end up being very successful for you. So investing is not wrong. But you should know that there are probably hundreds of Cryptos doing the same thing, solving the same problem. So it's very hard to find something legit and uniquely new nowadays in Crypto."
5,You can’t say you’re for crypto adoption and then be upset that the wealthy are investing in crypto.,72,tpf986,1648367741.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tpf986/you_cant_say_youre_for_crypto_adoption_and_then/,50,"I see so many people who say things like 

“..that’s because they have VC money now.”

“[x] just invested in Bitcoin. Great now they’re going to manipulate the market”

“Banks are investing now? What happened to ‘Bitcoin is for fraudsters’ >:( huh?”

And many more.

Like, what the fuck do you expect? Crypto to take off and the worlds billionaires and millionaires to not get with the program?

You should be happy that as more big institutional money enters the crypto world, the total crypto marketcap increases, raises all boats and you, having already been invested, are making profits. Y’all need to accept that the people you don’t like have access to the same information that you do and they are going to invest in your coins. That’s the whole point. That’s what we’re here early for. To take advantage of the relatively small marketcap right now so we can be well off in 10 years when inevitably the MC will be probably 5+ trillion.

P.s. stop buying coins that influencers are telling you to buy. Please. 

You are their exit liquidity."

7,Nano may or may not be too good to be true. But lets at least understand what we are arguing about,53,tpg23m,1648371523.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tpg23m/nano_may_or_may_not_be_too_good_to_be_true_but/,73,"By far the most common point made against Nano is that there is no incentive to run a node. What people mean by this is that the protocol does not provide payouts to active nodes. This is in fact true. And while there are many valid counter arguments being made about whether payouts to nodes are necessary, these counter arguments seem to forget one crucial thing: **Bitcoin does not provide an incentive to run a node.** Yes I wrote that correctly. The Bitcoin protocol provides absolutely no payout for running a node.

Now I know what you are thinking. “Yea it does, miners get paid”. But that idea is missing an important detail: Miners are not nodes and nodes are not miners. Sure most mining pools also run nodes, but you can also mine without running a node. 

What is a node? A node an entity that listens to network information (blocks, transactions, etc) from the other nodes that it is connected to, and relays that information to the nodes that are connected to it. A node listens to blocks and transactions, and relays those blocks and transactions.

In order to be a miner the only network interactions you must make are to: listen for blocks and transactions, and to send out the small percentage of blocks that you mine to one or more nodes. In order to qualify as a node, you would also need to relay blocks that you didn’t mine.

The next logical counter argument is “why bother differentiating if all the mining pools run nodes anyway”? And this is a very good point. So good in fact, that it’s the philosophy upon which Nano is built. 

Why do all the mining pools run nodes? Because it is convenient to do so. They are already listening to blocks and sending out occasional block solutions, so why not just relay all the blocks to listeners and run a full node. 

Miners are just players in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Just like people who pay using bitcoin are players in the ecosystem. Just like Bitcoin exchanges and businesses that accept Bitcoin are players in the ecosystem. For some of these players it is convenient to run nodes, and for others it isn’t. Most people who buy stuff with bitcoin do so infrequently enough that it is not worthwhile to run a node full time. But most exchanges handle so many transactions that they may as well run nodes of their own. That is why most exchanges do, in fact, run their own nodes. Just like a lot of bitcoin businesses do. These nodes are what keep the bitcoin network alive. Without nodes there is no mining. Mining is nothing more than bitcoin’s solution to the byzantine emperor problem. The existence of nodes is a product of the convenience of doing so.

And this is the idea behind Nano. If a business wants accept Nano for goods and services, they would most likely want to listen to transactions on the Nano network to be aware of money received. So just like the Bitcoin miners, they may as well relay those transactions along in the network, and run a full node. Likewise exchanges would want to run their own nodes for the same reason. And guess what, they do. Just about every exchange that accepts Nano runs its own node. People run Nano nodes for the same indirect incentives that make people run bitcoin nodes: Its convenient.

I can go on about how Nano’s voting system works synergistically with the indirect incentive to run nodes, but this post is getting long and that’s a topic for another post. But can we finally put this argument to rest? Network players do not need a direct payout to be incentivized to run nodes.

**TLDR: Nano provides no incentive to run a node, but neither does Bitcoin.**"

To make quick money. ""Why do you care about price going up or down if you are never selling?"" and other silly arguments.


And let me tell you. Yes the majority here, is in it for the money. It's because we are screwed. The society is still expecting an average male to earn a lot of money and provide for their family etc. but people in their 30s have been f**d in the arse for the last 15 years or more. 


No wage growth, no prospects in many countries, constant financial crisis that keeps hitting and hitting us from all sides, and now inflation which will melt our savings, that is if we are lucky to have any savings in the first place, education system is a joke in most countries, crippling debts, high cost of living, rents going up and up, and so on and on, I could go on forever.


Crypto for a lot of us is the only way out, our only way to be able to afford a house or a flat in the future. So yeah, you bet I'm in it for the money and I don't give a damn what people think. Priority number one for me is to provide for my family.

10,"Besides trying to get rich quick, what are the main avenues the average person gets introduced into crypto these days?",28,tpfwql,1648370797.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tpfwql/besides_trying_to_get_rich_quick_what_are_the/,122,"I originally learnt and got introduced to crypto back in 2012-14ish (can't remember exactly, Bitcoin was worth $70 when I first purchased) due to learning about dark markets (e.g. original silk road) and being intrigued but what was out there.

I ended up purchasing a few things out of interest and trying to figure it all out. 

It seemed back then this was the main reason people flocked to crypto, but now with the smorgasbord of coins and different aims and markets is there still some stand out reasons people get into it (besides the obvious)?"
11,"Nano is, in fact, too good to be true. Please don't tell your loved ones to buy it. Blaring security flaws and other issues inside this thread.",41,tpdyv8,1648361714.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tpdyv8/nano_is_in_fact_too_good_to_be_true_please_dont/,194,"**TL;DR - Nano cannot survive nation bans like bitcoin can, the lightning network is a working product. When you tell friends and family to buy Nano, you are putting them in financial danger.**                 

First and foremost, it is **wonderful** to have a product that works, right? I'm sure we can agree with that. But what if you have a product that only works and has been working so long because of security flaws that nobody has noticed enough to exploit.                  

I advise you to check out this short 30 second video on using a non-custodial bitcoin lightning wallet as it's much safer, much more secure, and it comes from the world's most popular crypto asset, Bitcoin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW-7XBrSqCI                

Well, what is the problem with Nano? Andreas Antonopolous has said this before on his YouTube channel in this video (The timestamp is 28:08): https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1688&v=fEPW6RXMGmA&feature=emb_title                

To paraphrase: He basically said that Nano hasn't been used at scale enough to compare with bitcoin. This means it's like the skinny guy at the gym who is 5'10"" (178cm) and 140 pounds (63.5KG) laughing at all the guys who are muscular but have a *little* difficulty benchpressing their own bodyweight. The skinny guy, in this example, can be thought of as Nano / the nano community because they think the big buff muscular guys struggling is funny even though they haven't had a chance to lift anything beyond the empty bar at all.                 

**Six months after the above video was uploaded / streamed to Aantonopolous's channel, the Nano Network was given a nearly never-ending spam attack that didn't change until the protocol at its core was changed.**                 

Another blaring security flaw: Bitcoin survived the Chinese-government mandated mining purge. Anything and everything cryptocurrency-related in China is now illegal and that includes running a Nano node. There are less than 100 Nano node runners globally and if governments, internet service providers, or companies in general wanted to forcefully remove these individuals or entities from running a Nano node, they could do so with relative ease, **however, when you take a bitcoin mining operation offline, there are always 10 people willing to rise up and take the place of that mining individual.** When a nano node gets shut down, it gets shut down. There is no incentive to rise up and replace the node that was just shut down.                    

And then there is just systematic and uncontrollable brigading that comes from the Nano community, and it is lead on by the delusional belief that Nano is somehow superior to bitcoin. If you were to check out their subreddit, you would also quickly realize that not enough people are questioning the safety of the protocol. Oh, and let's not forget that Nano cannot work with smart contracts. So it can't do defy or swaps or anything like that.                

Reaction to the delusional from the master himself on twitter: https://imgur.com/a/EPzTXYw                 

Finally, this trend **must** be discussed: price action. In the 2017 bull run Bitcoin peaked at 20k USD while Nano peaked a month later at 35 USD. Bitcoin is now at 44.6k USD while Nano is at 2 USD. This is **not** self-sustaining, and if this trend continues, the amount of bitcoin on the lightning network in USD will likely surpass Nano's total market cap in USD in under a year.

EDIT: Running an optimal Nano node requires server grade hardware or renting a server and deploying a node on that server. You think an ISP or AWS or whatever cloud-hosting platform won't shut it down if someone orders them to do it?"

Most dictionaries say when control is in the hands of two or more entities it is considered decentralized. Centralized would mean all the control is in the hands of only 1 entity. But I see people complain all the time on this sub that X isn't decentralized bc it only has Y number of decision makers. 

So what does everyone think about this? How many entities are needed for something to be considered decentralized? 2? 10? 25? 100? 1000? 

Some examples for clarity;
Would a Blockchain with 1000 nodes be considered decentralized? 
Is 200 governance token holders enough for decentralization?
Is the internet decentralized with 16 Tier 1 global networks?

I know it's a complex subject, but spit out some examples if you have them."
19,Advice for newcomers to Crypto: it’s never (including now) the time to FOMO,14,tpfvkj,1648370638.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tpfvkj/advice_for_newcomers_to_crypto_its_never/,19,"Hi all, so if you’re new to crypto you may be seeing something exciting and unfamiliar from recent times - GREEN portfolios.

So, what the hell should I do with this? And my emotions?

Well - emotions have no place whatsoever in investing, they will only work against you.

In the coldest sense, if you are in a project for the long haul the opposite of your emotional response is probably best (buy when everybody is selling and it’s low, sell a bit when it’s high) - but obviously that’s vanilla and near impossible to execute.

So how do we avoid this? DCA! What does that mean? Dollar cost averaging or basically a committed regular investment.

If you truly AREN’T in this for a unicorn “quick buck” then if you invest consistently (per month set £/€/$ amount) at the same rate, you aren’t trying to predict intraday swings and instead you just believe in a few years + it’ll be higher.

Much less stressful, requires no intelligence short of the obviously disclaimer - be careful which projects you back and stay away from moonshots and sh*tcoins.

Hope this was helpful!"

Even though its rate cut in this market condition and due to the scale of business is understandable, some transparency and communication will go a long way.

However can’t help but notice this is exactly what banks do, the past couple of years their interest rates have been plummeting and there’s practically no communication to the customers about it. Customers will only see their interest paying continuously shrink, and will have to manually look up interest rates, only to see it keep falling.

There’s way too many people that say this but then invest 80% of their savings account and then lose everything when it crashes.

A fantastic way to trick yourself into working around this and not letting yourself invest too much is to simply tell yourself that the money you put into crypto you will never see ever again. 

This way you aren’t tricking yourself into “well this $100 is going to turn into $10,000 and I’ll be golden” and then continually put in $100 daily and end up with all your money gone. Doing it this way means that *any* money you get in return is a positive. You invested $50 but 6 months later deposit $25? For all your budget knows, you just gained $25 and the $50 you spent 6 months ago is gone.

I don’t put my crypto portfolio (or stock portfolio for that matter) into my budgeting app. I have a set budget every month for crypto and that’s all I spend, I tell myself it’s a bill or something fun and that the money I just spent, I’ll never see again.

We're very excited to share this giveaway with you and thankful to the mods for the opportunity.


# What is Krypto Kitty?

Krypto Kitty is a deflationary reflective meowmcoin, with a focus on balanced tokenomics, organic growth, charitable engagements, and free-market principles. 

We just love cats! We felt cats were not getting much love in crypto, and thus a meowmcoin was born. But we sought to distinguish KTY from other tokens of late, particularly in the last year, that engage in cynical shilling and unedifying marketing gimmicks to lure and exploit newcomers to crypto with pump and dump schemes. This is not what crypto should be about. It's neither ethical nor sustainable.

Instead, we wanted to build something that was equitable, deliberate and sustainable in its approach. We think that there's room in this space for a project that, rather than exploiting newcomers, does a little to educate them and engage positively without any unscrupulous or deceptive practices.

We believe pets inspired so-called meme coins have their place in the crypto world. Memes are a cultural phenomenon, a form of human expression which can be not only entertaining but also educational and thought-provoking. But every crypto needs sound fundamentals and sincere endeavour to create sustainable value.

One of Krypto Kitty's core tenets is charitable engagements with pet rescue and shelter organizations. 10% of the total KTY supply has been set aside for charity.

As some of you may remember, a couple of months ago before Krypto Kitty was launched, we had an exclusive airdrop right here for members of this subreddit. Many of the original founding group of Krypto Kitty were in fact members of r/cc Telegram group.

Following this, we had a public sale round (there were no private sales). Investors in the public sale were limited to a maximum of only 0.5% of total supply. Although it deprived us of some early development funding, this is something we're very proud of and we're confident that this strict anti-whale policy will stand KTY in good stead in the long run.

Planned functionalities of Krypto Kitty include NFT collections (coming very soon), Free-to-Play-to-Earn games, Kitty DAO and The Kittyverse.

Chances are, it was because crypto was largely topical in the media. News, comedians, and all else in between were talking about it as source material and it was *the* hot topic. 

I like to read the news mostly to see what they are talking about, as it generally points me toward the things they aren’t discussing. By the time the news is riding it, it’s being talked about everywhere and the opportunities have dried up for larger profits. Get in and consider the *quiet* areas of the market, crypto or otherwise. 

While crypto is still present in the news, it’s certainly a shadow of early 2021 hype. Without pretending to know what is to come, my advice is keep an eye on the news and if Bitcoin prices stop appearing on the nightly review, you may want to start looking a little harder… 

Put simply, the news is handy in that things not being spoken of are often where the real money is waiting to be made. The things that are all over the news have already left the station."

I don't want a money grab or a paywall; I want a universal communication system for games.

A few years ago, I played Call of Duty Blacksops 2. It was the pinacle of my teenage years and I a few buddies, and I grinded the game and got all of the gold skins and achievements. This took a few hundred hours. Now, the game is dead, and I can no longer look at those skins and achievements. I can't play with them, and I can't display them on my Steam profile.

Now, I recently started playing Call of Duty mobile, and I really love the game, but now I need to unlock and grind all of the same skins again. This isn't actually a problem, but it got me thinking. Once they abandon this game, make a new one, and I will need to do it all over again.

What I want is for these skins and achievements to be NFTs. Once I unlock the skin, I can mint it to my ETH or whatever account and hold it there. If the company or game goes under, I still have them. I can display and hold them as I wish. Once a new game is made, I should be able to import my NFTs , play with them , display them as legacy skins, and maybe unlock the new ones again.

Now, r/buttcoin will say: ""Yes, but wHY hAvE nFtS thEn??"". Well, you know what. All NFTs do not have value. I never want to sell these and I don't want to buy yours. I want to have them. I want to unlock and own them. I want the blockchain to act as a standard for how skins are communicated and transferred between games.

By using a blockchain, a standard communication protocol can be made because how things are now, Battlefield 5, and Call of Duty games will ""never"" speak to each other. And bug corporations will exclude other indie developers from their communication systems. By having an open source standard, it is free and open to use for all.

These unlocked skins will have no monetary value for me. Others can buy and sell them; I don't want to make money from this. This isn't even play to earn. I just want to own my achievements. I am actually turned off from grinding the new game, knowing that I no longer have access to assets of a game that I bought and owned 10 years ago.

Boomers, you have your holloahoop collection and baseball cards. Allow me to display my skins on my steam profile and own them. It is exactly the same; mine is just digital. Your frisbees and stupid baseball cards have no value to me. I will never buy a stupid furbie or whatever those 90s dolls were called, but for you, they are worth 10k USD. My skins have no monetary value. So aren't you the ones collecting and attaching monetary value to something stupid?"

Staking is part of the blockchain, so you don’t need to hold your crypto on an exchange to stake. E.g. Yoroi (ADA), Phantom (SOL), Lido (ETH), Ledger Live (multiple). This is a question I get all the time, and the answer is yes! Usually, people say, ‘I want to hold my own coins, but I still want to stake, so I keep them on an exchange.’

It doesn’t have to be this way — you can stake in a self-custodial wallet (including when your coins are in coin storage).

If your coin supports staking, google ‘best wallet to stake <cryptocurrency ticker symbol>.’

If you’re still having trouble getting it setup, go onto YouTube and search for whatever you want. E.g. ‘how to stake on Yoroi.’

I can’t give you the step-by-step guide to every coin because they all differ and I don’t own every coin.

But if we bother to go down the rabbit hole, the explanation is quite simple: the market gets a bit depressed, the demand for stable coins raise, the rewards for holding them lows (the yields) because more people rather be on stables/cash other than be invested, so then need a smaller reward to do so.

If you look into other platforms the same happen, even if you look into LP mining in stablecoins it’s the same.

He added that measures should be taken to further regulate mining. The prime minister recalled that last month the government approved the concept of the Ministry of Finance, which outlined these issues in detail.

In the concept of the department, it is proposed to carry out all operations with cryptocurrencies through Russian banks, identify the holders of crypto wallets and divide customers into qualified and unqualified investors.

At the same time, the Bank of Russia is actively advocating a ban on the issuance and circulation of private digital currencies in the country. On February 18, the regulator presented a draft law, which provides for a ban on the organization of the issuance of cryptocurrency and its circulation, as well as on the dissemination of information about it. The project also prohibits banks and other financial market participants from owning private digital currencies.

I started writing a piece about why we shouldn’t mind KYC unless we’re criminals, and through my journey, I realized I was totally wrong.

First, there’s a data breach; once a hack happens on all KYC data, the amount of info they will get would be astounding. They could literally take your ID and sell them to identity thieves if they don’t use them themselves. 

The second is that all of that information you supply can be used against you without a warrant. Of course, if you are not a criminal, you think you have nothing to worry about. But there are more instances than not of people being wrongly implicated in crimes.  

Third, people have to go through a lot of fucking shit to provide the necessary assets for KYC, and some people don’t have the means to do that. 

This was definitely a lesson in DYOR for me. A total turnaround in viewpoint."

I wanted to ask few questions and get few perspectives on a crypto-mining related  topic. In one of my courses for college, we(my classmates) wanted to see if crypto-mining mining generates enough heat that can be introduced into any District Heating systems of countries such as Nordics. So, 

1. If you were to build a huge mining farm, would you want additional revenue source by selling the heat?
2. Would you want your factory/farm to be green or clean? 

Also please, let me know what you think about this large scale heat extraction from crypto-mining. 

Thank you."

Now that we are seeing the conflict with updates from sources like TikTok it seems that issuing content on a blockchain will be the only way to avoid it being co-opted by others, modified without disclosure, or used without the complete original context. Curious to hear others thoughts on this."

76,The unspoken truth about LIVE CAM SITES.,2,tpfwvg,1648370815.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tpfwvg/the_unspoken_truth_about_live_cam_sites/,17,"  

**The fastest-growing, 24/7, sector of the global porn industry**, also known as “*the pearl of the porn industry*”. 

· Cam sites are one of the most popular websites on the internet.

· At least **12500 cam models** and **240000 viewers** at **any given moment**.

· The live cam shows know their beginning only 6 years after “the Trojan coffee room”.

· The potential to create **digital relationships** and fulfill more **personal fantasies** and consequently **experience porn on a different level**. 

· Already generated **1 billion dollar in 2013** and is worth **10 billion to this day** with a **29 percent increase** in users in the year 2019-2020.

· We have observed an important emergence of this sector, even in **national economies** such as: Colombia, Romania or the Phillippines.

In other words , it has become “*the engine of the porn industry*”.

\-->  ***The beautiful victims***

An essential part of this thriving sector is, of course, the women who perform. These are attracted through various promises such as *“make up to 10000$ per month” “becoming a cam girl can make all your dreams come true”, “becoming financially independent”,*  which are not outright lies but are **deceptions**. The real question to be asked is what am I willing to do to achieve all that I have been promised? 

Many women experience **emotional stress** as a result of their performances. This is due to the fact that they are sometimes indirectly forced by the cam studios to do things they do not want to do, extreme things, things they never saw themselves doing in the first place. Besides that, cam girls are left with no support if they are subjected to stalking or harassment from clients. As a result, many women stop (if they even have that possibility) after few months of working.

In addition to the emotional stress these women may experience, **the money promised is also misleading**.

FIRST of all, we see that companies typically treat performers as **independent contractors**, there are no guarantees and one could work for hours and make very little. The moment those models work **under** contract to studios they have **the risk to be exploited or even being victims of cybersex trafficking**. 

SECONDLY, the amount of money that can be earned is shown without mentioning that the platforms take a **commission**. 

· The largest platforms such as Chaturbate, camsoda, or stripchat have a **50% commission** on what the cam girls earn in total! On private sites it goes up to **70%!** 

· Since major credit card companies don't process payments from adult entertainment sites due to regularisation, cam sites rely on **third-party platforms** that often charge another **5-10% of the model's revenue**. 

· If you think it couldn’t be worse, cam sites that allow viewers to **tip** performers typically require a **65-75%** cut of the model's earnings, sometimes ON TOP OF OTHER PROCESSING FEES!

53% of women confirm that starting on these cam sites is for **financial reasons**. How many are there who do it because they can't make ends meet in the month while they already have a job? How many of those women may still have children to support? Here is an example of a perspective of the situation, which may be experienced as such by many. Eva (camgirl since 2010); ***It was sex work or starvation. There is no doubt in my mind that there is a direct correlation between poverty, austerity, and sex work. To deny that is misogyny.”*** As you can see, this situation can only put vulnerable women in an even more merciful situation for disproportionate profits from centralized services. 

***--> The solution!***

You probably know where I'm going, **BLOCKCHAIN**. We know the potential and this could be the solution to this problem. **Decentralization** can put an end to abuse done by a fast-growing market that has always had its dark sides. Instead of exploiting the models like the classic sites, you want to create a path where we offer them **financial freedom** and they can choose to do this by choice rather than necessity. We want to break the vicious circle trapping so many women in this business.

***--> HotCams***

As an example for the fact that the solution is possible, lets take a look to a start-up crypto project that has exploited the benefits of blockchain in anticipation of the current problem, HotCams. 

HotCams, as a **socialized re-distribution DeFi protocol**, helps models to earn much more, and receive their fair share via **disintermediation**. This is by creating a fully functional platform that prepares all the tools so that women can start independently and that for **!20$ per month!** Instead of having to give at least half of their revenues. 

Besides that, they can earn **tips** through MetaMask **without having to withhold part of their wages**. Finally, the actress is also entitled to **3% rewards** on all transactions made on the platform. **Instead of the actress paying commission, she is entitled to rewards here, which makes a lot more sense when one contributes to the platform**. In addition, the platform offers all possible tools so that women can use the platform to their fullest potential. As an illustration of this, they have arranged a **starting collaboration with the a leading company, Lovense**. In other words, HotCams use **blockchain technology** to offer **real independence** for camgirls, it doesn't focus on the anonymity of the user, but on a **fair and safer working environment for actresses** who are already venturing into a risky sector with a lot of uncertainty. (If you want to know more about this innovative project, check out the resources below (Yahoo Finance article)) 

***--> The Conclusion***

By the rules of the sub, we are not allowed to be maximalists for a certain coin, BUT, let's not forget that we are still maximalists for the blockchain technology that can come up with solutions for minorities in our society. We have a minority here, we have a problem and we have a solution, now let's bring them together and admire the magic potential of blockchain 

Ultimately, sex and projecting sexuality are just part of life. But this could be without all the abuse and violence surrounding this sector.

Basically, I want to study web design + coding but I don't have a laptop/PC. I've made enough to cover buying one, but there is a potential for my investments to grow much higher

So, if I cash out I'll be able to get myself a laptop to start studying something which is in itself an investment of sorts that may or may not pay off depending on my success.

Alternatively, if I wait, my investment portfolio may grow and I'll be in a better position. 

It's difficult because both options feel like there's gambling aspects to it - I might not get a job out of studying web design & my investments could be unsuccessful 

So how do you make decisions like this? Its difficult to weigh up and I appreciate any suggestions

88,ETH Scalability: L2s explained,55,toksvc,1648286363.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/toksvc/eth_scalability_l2s_explained/,57,"Seeing that there's some confusion about L1 and L2, I thought to make a post explaining this once for all.

As the number of people using Ethereum has grown, the blockchain has reached certain capacity limitations.  This has driven up the cost of using the network, creating the need for ""*scaling solutions*""

The main goal of scalability is to increase:

\- **Transaction speed**

\- **Transaction throughput**

But without sacrificing decentralization or security: while speed and throughput are important, it is essential that scaling solutions enabling these goals remain **decentralized and secure**.

Let's start with the scaling solutions:

# On-chain scaling.

This method of scaling requires changes to the Ethereum protocol (layer 1 Mainnet).    
Sharding was the main focus of this method of scaling, but it is **no longer being used to scale the L1 network, it's instead been replaced with Supercharge Rollups.**

The original plan was to shard both data storage and transaction execution, but doing so turned out to be extremely complicated and could potentially be unsafe, so this plan was scrapped in favor of only sharding data storage, which is simpler and safer.

This way, shards essentially offer a scalable data storage layer to the Ethereum network, making it significantly cheaper to store data on the blockchain. Rollups can take advantage of this to pack even more L2 transactions in a single rollup batch, which will drive down the cost of individual users within rollups.

(You can read about the reasoning behind this [in this discussion thread from October 2020](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698), where Vitalik proposed a rollup-centric Ethereum roadmap, and you can see the fruition of this discussion here in [this tweet from Vitalik](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402), which shows that sharding is focused on scaling rollups, not the L1 network.) (Credits to u/jcm2606)

# Off-Chain scaling solutions: L2s.

First, what is a L2?

Layer 2s handle transactions off the Ethereum Mainnet (L1) while taking advantage of the decentralized security model of Mainnet. For some solutions, L2s then batch transactions into groups before anchoring them to L1, and after they are secured by L1, they cannot be altered.

Why do we need L2?

They have increased transactions per second (Also, they reduce the congestion on the L1), and they make Ethereum more inclusive and accessible to anyone. Their updates in scalability are not at the expense of decentralization or security.

They perform transactions outside the L1 and then post the data into the L1 where consensus is reached. As transaction data is included in L1 blocks, this allows rollups to be secured by native Ethereum security.

There are two types of Rollups:

\- Optimistic rollups: they assume transactions are valid by default and only run computation via a fraud-proof, in the event of a challenge.

\- Zero-knowledge rollups: runs computation off-chain and submits a validity proof to the chain. (ZK)

&#x200B;

* **State Channels**

They utilize multisig contracts to enable participants to transact quickly and freely off-chain, then settle finality with Mainnet. This minimizes network congestion, fees, and delays.

&#x200B;

* **Sidechains**

They are independent EVM-compatible blockchains that run in parallel to Mainnet.

These are compatible with Ethereum via two-way bridges and run under their own chosen rules of consensus, and block parameters. (ex: Polygon)

&#x200B;

* **Plasma**

A plasma chain is a separate blockchain that is anchored to the main Ethereum chain and uses fraud proofs (like optimistic rollups) to arbitrate disputes.

&#x200B;

* **Validium**

They use validity proofs like zero-knowledge rollups but the data is not stored on the Ethereum Mainnet.

This can lead to 10k transactions per second per Validium chain and multiple chains can be run in parallel.

&#x200B;

# Do we really need all of these solutions?

Yes and NO.  Multiple solutions can help reduce the overall congestion on any one part of the network, and also prevents single points of failure.

But no scaling solution is enough to fulfill the Ethereum vision.

I hope Ripple wins, but as a years long investoir I know that selling off, giving grants that yield to nothing (for all those years of giving them, what projects except xumm paid off? They gave hundreds of millions pf XRP so far), they will keep donating to get brownie points etc, all while investors hold a bag.

If Ripple wins the lawsuit, I would predict that there will be initial huge pump and then slow bleed like before all while Ripple tries to dillute market with XRP in ways that would not make it a security (so giving grants, donating, etc).

I understand that they are in precarious position as to they have to thread lightly, but as an investor it really is disheartening. I have made good decision of selling portion of my position and buying different coin which gave me x3 returns, all while XRP bag sits and is the worst investment so far, I could literally invest in even gold to get better returns, stocks would yield better as well. 

Also, initial dump after pump if Ripple wins by investors who just want to get out will be painful and volatility will be high which is another thing I am tired off."

For those who aren't familiar with my experiment, I'm DCAing into a mix of 16 alt-coins and using BTC, ETH and BUSD (with interest on BlockFi) as controls in a 1 year long project. I took feedback from the community to help set the roster of 16 coins, but also did a bit of my own research and picked projects which I believed in after doing some DD. I have posted at least a summary of my DD on each coin in previous posts and I will be donating some of the proceeds to a charity to be chosen by the person who suggested the best performing coin at the end of the experiment. For the starting point you can look here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q9z379/one\_year\_altcoin\_dca\_experiment/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q9z379/one_year_altcoin_dca_experiment/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the most recent update prior to today can be found here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tk8d59/one\_year\_altcoin\_dca\_experiment\_week\_22\_midweek/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tk8d59/one_year_altcoin_dca_experiment_week_22_midweek/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

It’s mostly a good update again this week as we’re seeing multiple weeks of slight gains now. Honestly March has been surprisingly good for both the crypto market and the stock market. I was nervous that we would see some downward pressure as the FED raised rates this month and who knows what the market is going to do in response to the situation in Ukraine, but amazingly March has been good. Now, if St. Peters wins the NCAA tournament, then anything can happen. (Go Peacocks!)

At any rate, you’re not here to listen to me go on about the situation in the world or the NCAA basketball tournament. If you’ve bothered to read this far it’s because you’re curious about how my DCA experiment is going. So without further ado, the financials:

Those of you who tune in regularly know that just a few weeks ago I was regularly posting updates about a project that was down over 20% and often the only coin that was even close to positive was LUNA. Now as the end of March approaches, the overall project is down just over 8%, I’ve got several projects sitting right on the edge of profitability and the big guys, BTC and ETH are down just over 2% and just under 6% respectively. Honestly, looking at the market and the broader macro trends just 3 or 4 weeks ago I wouldn’t have expected to be at this point today.

The one mild disappointment for this particular update is TRAC. I don’t know what was going on with that project but it had a major pump earlier in the week and as of my mid-week update on Tuesday it was actually up for the first time after having been the worst performing project in the entire experiment for several months. It’s dropped somewhat, although considering where it had been previously, somewhere in the middle of the pack doesn’t look so bad. I did decide to do my numbers as week over week numbers (ignoring the mid-week case), so it still looks good because as of last week’s update it was down pretty big.

Including TRAC, all but 2 of the coins in the bottom half of the portfolio had double digit week over week gains, driving the overall growth this past week. FTM currently sits in last place, I think because of the bad news that Andre Cronje and Anton Nell are leaving. I suspect FTM will recover as I don't think the project is doomed, although the lead developers leaving any program is bound to make an impact.

I guess if you follow traditional investing, now is the time to be fearful because everything is looking good. Who knows what next week will bring, but it’s hard to feel negative sentiment when the market is working in your favor like it has been the last couple of weeks.

Here’s the updated trend lines for each of the projects. I kept the mid-week update in the trend lines as well, so you can see the wild journey that TRAC in particular has been on this past week.

What I'm really happy about looking at the chart is how much the overall portfolio is beating the price of BTC change over time. Bitcoin's price is down over 27% since I started the experiment, yet the experiment is down just over 8%.

One other item that I like to look at is how I’m doing thanks to the DCA approach. Overall it is paying off quite well in what has been a mostly down market since the experiment started. If we start to have a significant bull run over the next few months, the benefit of DCA will fade, but in this down market it’s been quite a blessing.

Next week will mark week 24 of the project and I’ll reach the point where I’ve but $200 into each of the projects I’m working on. Here's what I purchased in the past week and what I'll be purchasing next week:

97,An introduction to Etica: A blockchain for funding open-source medical research,4,tp8959,1648340182.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tp8959/an_introduction_to_etica_a_blockchain_for_funding/,1,"I have been doing some reading on [Etica](https://np.reddit.com/r/etica), watched [the video](https://youtu.be/02FJgMVAHd8), and even read through [the whitepaper](https://www.eticaprotocol.org/viewwhitepaper), and so I wanted to share some of the things I've learned so you don't have to spend as much time researching as I did. I am not a developer or affiliated with the project, I am just somebody who is excited about it. It's quite possible I got some things wrong, so please chime in with any corrections and of course always trust but verify, I'm just some random person on the internet.

**First things, first, what is Etica?**

Etica is a blockchain and platform for funding medical research. It also produces **rewards** for those who evaluate research proposals and vote on them or otherwise participate in Etica. These can fundamentally change how scientific research is incentivized, opening a new world of patent-free, open medical research. Etica runs off its own version of the Ethereum Classic blockchain, which uses proof-of-work to mint coins and secure the network. These coins are called ETI (Etica). Like any Ethererum fork, it has its own [mining procedure](https://www.reddit.com/r/Etica/comments/t2vtze/quick_video_on_how_to_mine_etica_how_to_transact/), [blockchain explorer](https://eticascan.org/), and [mining pool](http://eticapool.com:3000/). The Etica blockchain also supports smart contracts so in theory it could provide an ecosystem for scientific tools, support NFTs, etc. 

**How does Etica fund research?**

Researchers submit proposals for funding which are voted on by Etica users (that's you!). Proposals are grouped by disease and compete against other proposals for that same disease. Proposals which receive a sufficient vote will be minted new coins as part of Etica's approximately 2% built-in currency supply inflation. Proposals can be requests for funding, results of research, or really anything else you can think of, the community decides what should be funded and when. If you're interested in other ways that crypto can help science, check out the sub [cryptoforscience](https://np.reddit.com/r/cryptoforscience).

**What gives Etica value? If we fund researchers with Etica, they will sell it creating sell pressure, where is the buy pressure? Who will use Etica?**

The buy pressure for Etica comes from two places: people wanting to help direct large amounts of research funding and people wanting to apply for funding. Applying for funding requires you have some Etica first. And if you want a say in how Etica is distributed, the more Etica you buy, the larger say you have. Who wants to influence which research gets funding? Individual people who are passionate about research, of course, as well as researchers making their own proposals, organizations focused on researching a particular disease, academic instutions, people or their loved ones who are effected by a disease, private industry who would benefit by more foundational research being done on a disease (for example a company who makes pipettes), governments of regions hit hard by a particular disease, etc. In this way, Etica can bring together all stakeholders in the medical research process. Medical research provides a net benefit to society as a whole, and a host of benefits to many different groups within it, therefore there are ample types of people and organizations who would want to participate in Etica.

Voting on proposals also earns you a share of the reward. In this way, shares in Etica can be compared to shares in a pharmaceutical company. In each case, you buy the shares based on expected returns and also gain the ability to influence the decisions of the company if you have enough of them. Unlike a pharmaceutical company though, Etica users get to propose and vote on proposals directly, and even holding just one etica entitles you to a vote. In this way, Etica provides a financial incentive for participating in it, even somebody of pure financial motiviation with no interest in medical research might see value in buying and holding Etica. Of course, Etica's value relative to other currencies is determined by many factors and it would be foolish to try and predict what that will be. I am not trying to pitch Etica as an investment vehicle here.

And unlike traditional CeSci (centralized science), Etica removes the multi-million dollar barriers to entry required for traditional investment in/funding of medical research as you can participate with as little or as much Etica as you like.

**How does voting work? Staking?**

Votes on proposals are private and can be cast for 21 days after the proposal is made. After this, point, they become public. This is to keep voters honest, make them come to their own evaluation of the proposal, and make sure they aren't just ""voting with the crowd"". Etica users who vote on successful proposals receive a share of the reward (the person(s) who submitted the proposal receive the other part).

In order to submit proposals or vote on proposals, you must stake your Etica. This means temporarily locking up your Etica for 28 days. If you vote ""yes"" on a proposal that is ultimately successful (a good proposal), you can withdraw your Etica and any rewards you earned. If you voted ""yes"" on an unsuccessful proposal, you receive no reward and your stake will be ""slashed"" which means it will continue to be locked up for a certain amount of more days. The amount of days and the reward you receive (if any) is determined on how well you voted. The more unpopular a proposal is that you voted ""yes"" to, the longer you will get slashed. Conversely, voting ""for"" really popular proposals will result in you getting greater rewards.

What % of the vote is required to make a proposal pass is dependent on how successful previous proposals were. A ""ratio target"" is established to keep things balanced, I encourage you to check out the whitepaper if you want to read about the details. In short, this insures that not a ratio of passed to not passed proposals is kept. This avoids everyone voting ""yes"" on all proposals to game the system.

A note on protection against bad actors: If you vote for an extremely unpopular proposal (>90% of votes against), you will actually lose some of the Etica you have staked (up to 33%). This is to discourage bad actors. Similarly, if you submit a proposal and 90% of votes are against it, you lose up to 100% of the Etica you staked to make that proposal. So long as you submit and vote on reasonable proposals, this in theory should not happen to you, it should only happen to junk/spam/bad faith proposals and votes.

**How do I obtain Etica?**

You can mine Etica or submit proposals to be voted on, you must already have some Etica and stake it to submit a proposal. Once people have mined some Etica, you can buy it from them (or from an exchange, whenever it is listed on an exchange). Presumably, generous community members will step up to make a faucet at some point.

**Tokenomics? Inflationary/deflationary?**

Etica does not have an ICO or any pre-minted coins. Etica is distributed in two phases. Phase 1 is expected to last about ten years and will distribute 21 million Eticas through mining and protocol rewards. The goal of phase one is to distribute these as widely as possible as the network grows, as Etica are used to vote. In each phase (approx 1 year, so 10 phases), the ratio of rewards to mining and protocol rewards will decrease. So in year 1, 90% will go to mining with 10% to protocol rewards, in year 2, 80% to mining and 20% to protoclo rewards, etc.

In phase two, mining rewards will stop and new coins will only be minted through the approx 2.5% built-in supply inflation. These coins are distributed to people who stake/vote/submit proposals.

If you are familiar with ERC-20 tokens, Etherum, etc, you can simply think of Etica as an ERC-20 token which is distributed through mining, except that the ERC-20 contract lives on a fork of Ethereum instead of Ethereum main net, this is mainly to avoid gas fees. This fork has its own Eth currency as well, and presumably gas.

One other term to be aware of is Bosoms. When you stake your Etica, you receive an equal number of Bosoms. Bosoms are used to cast your actual votes and have no use outside of the little life they live inside the smart contract.

On inflationary/deflationary, the protocol has a built-in inflation of 2.5% (this is how research is funded). However, I believe slashes for submitting/voting on extremely unpopular proposals would be a deflationary pressure as well, though it depends on how common those are. Much like Ethereum, whether the supply is inflationary or deflationary depends on how the network is performing.

**Wait, so if Etica is being mined and eventually mining stops, how will the network be secured?**

There are actually two kinds of mining. The first main kind of mining is mining Etica, that is what follows the tokenomics above. But remember that Etica is a token produced by an ERC-20 smart contract on the Etica blockchain which is a clone of Ethereum classic. Ethereum classic is a proof-of-work blockchain that has its own mining requirements and native token (eth) which is used to pay for transactions that use the Etica smart contract. I do not know the tokenomics of this base layer, but suffice to say that in order to use Etica and interact with the ERC-20 smart contract, you must obtain and spend eth which must be mined, so this provides incentive for miners and security of the blockchain. One good thing about being based on Ethereum is that it should be relatively easy to build bridges to other blockchains which connect to Ethereum. Additionally, as Etica's voting and token distribution is done via an ERC-20 contract, it should be hostable on any EVM-compatible blockchain should running an Etica-specific blockchain not be desireable in the future for some reason.

**Why make another Proof-of-Work coin? Isn't is a huge waste of energy? Isn't it out-dated?**

I can't speak for the developer here, but I will just quickly list some points about this as I had the same question/criticism. Etica relies on the coins being distributed as widely and fairly as possible, this is really important as the coins are used for voting, and proof-of-work is really the only way to do this. Anybody with a computer can mine Etica, which makes it very accessible. The PoW emissions plan means that Etica will continue to exist and be mined along its planned trajectory of over a decade so long as people are mining it.

With proof-of-stake, it is difficult to insure the network's security at the start because you must mint and distribute enough coins to build up a base of stakers. If you mint all the coins at the start, and you must come up with a fair distribution mechanism. This is really difficult to do in a short timespan unlike the many year or many decade time-span PoW can take. Often this involves selling the coins (and keeping some for the founders/developers) which is difficult to do if you don't have access to an exchange, and they can be quickly bought up/used for speculation and not experience the slower, more organic type of growth that PoW can provide. Getting listed on exhanges is expensive and difficult, especially for new projects. PoW is proven technology, and PoS still has some learning to do.

On the energy question, I would argue there are few better places to put energy than into medical research. And not just medical research, but a system that may fundamentally and radically improve the speed and value of the medical research that society produces."
